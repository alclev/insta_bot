# Instagram Account Creation Automation with Selenium
## Overview
This project demonstrates a rudimentary solution for automating account creation on Instagram using the Selenium API in Python. It's important to note that this project is for educational purposes only and serves as a basic introduction to web automation with Selenium. It does not incorporate interval randomization or proper browser headers, making it far from a comprehensive solution. Additionally, please be aware that this project may not work as intended due to Instagram's evolving security measures.

## Selenium and Web Automation
### Selenium
Selenium is a powerful web automation framework that allows developers to interact with web browsers programmatically. In this project, we utilize the Python bindings of Selenium to automate the account creation process on Instagram.

### How the Program and Selenium Works
Selenium works by controlling web browsers through browser-specific drivers. It provides a high-level API for automating browser actions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating web pages. In this project, Selenium is used to automate the following steps of the Instagram account creation process:
1. Create randomized credentials using fake API
2. Brute force username options until one works (subject to rate limiting)
3. Move on to birthday page
4. Choose random birthday using specialized CSS selectors
5. Bypass 2FA
6. Submit account creation

### Educational Purposes
This project is designed solely for educational purposes to help individuals learn about web automation and Selenium. It should not be used for any malicious activities, spamming, or unauthorized access to Instagram or any other platform.
